Simple OpenCV program to detect extreme changes in contour area (pixels) between frames in a video. No deep learning algos, just simple math. 

Great for CCTV footages where there are usually no changes in the environment. The aim would be to detect changes as that would usually refer to events that requires attention. Eg. A house break-in

Example:
<img width="1280" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf38dada-414a-4c6d-808a-f61f0a37d845" />
