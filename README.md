Simple OpenCV program to detect extreme changes in contour area (pixels) between frames in a video. No deep learning algos, just simple math. 

Great for CCTV footages where there are usually no changes in the environment and changes would usually refer to some event that requires attention. Eg. A house breakin

Example:
<img width="1280" height="720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf38dada-414a-4c6d-808a-f61f0a37d845" />
